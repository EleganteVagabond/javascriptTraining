Import finds exported objects in a given javascript file
--can use relative paths for in-project files or identifiers for globals

If we use the var keyword for a variable it can be accessed outside of a method/class, use let or const instead

When assigning variables you can use a destructuring assignment using {} pulls it from the value on the right, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let
-ex let { bar } = foo; // where foo = { bar:10, baz:12 }; -> creates variable bar in local scope and assigns it the value of foo['bar'];

== is a shallow equals, use !== for a deep equals
