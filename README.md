# Javascript Training

I wanted to learn how to use `Node` and `React` and ended up in the `Redux`, `Bootstrap` and `Mongo` worlds as well. Quite a journey.

Personally I feel like the front end technologies change too quickly for me to get too excited about it. For example, I learned a component focused version of react but thne when I started a job we were using callbacks so I had to learn a new paradigm. It also seems like the flavor of the week carousel between `Vue` and `Angular` and `React`. I can do it but I don't really want to :)

I also find it amusing how most interpreted, un-typed programming languages (e.g. `Javascript`, `PHP`, `Python`) seem to asymptotically approach *fully type safe* languages like `Java` and `C++`. Eventually you learn that while it's cool that you can assign anything to a value, it's also a PITA to figure out what went wrong down the line when assumptions about types don't meet execution.
